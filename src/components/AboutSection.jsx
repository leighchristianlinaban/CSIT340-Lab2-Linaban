        I grew up in Basak San Nicholas, but due to we have no permanent address, we moved place to place here in Cebu and we are currently living in Punta Princesa. I chosed IT because I
        was amazed on how to build things people actually open. So far my favorite part is the moment
        when I understand how something works.
